    <h1>The earliest published version of “The Man from Nantucket” appeared in 1902 in the Princeton Tiger written by Professor Dayton Voorhees.</h1>
<p>
        There once was a man from Nantucket </br>
        Who kept all his cash in a bucket.  </br>
        But his daughter, named Nan,        </br>
        Ran away with a man                 </br>
        And as for the bucket, Nantucket.   </br>
</p>
    <h1>Other publications seized upon the "Nantucket" motif, spawning many sequels. Among the most well-known are:</h1>
<p>
        But he followed the pair to Pawtucket,  </br>
        The man and the girl with the bucket;   </br>
        And he said to the man,                 </br>
        He was welcome to Nan,                  </br>   
        But as for the bucket, Pawtucket.       </br>
</p>

    <h1>Followed later by:</h1>
<p>
        Then the pair followed Pa to Manhasset, </br>
        Where he still held the cash as an asset,  </br>
        But Nan and the man                     </br>
        Stole the money and ran,                </br>
        And as for the bucket, Manhasset.       </br>

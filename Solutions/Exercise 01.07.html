Mary had a little Lamb,<br>
its fleece was white as Snow.<br>
and everywhere that Mary went,<br>
the Lamb was sure to go.<br>
He followed her to school one day,<br>
that was against the rule.<br>
It made the children laugh and play,<br>
To see a Lamb at school.<br>

(This can be helpful if you have a lot of nested elements.)
